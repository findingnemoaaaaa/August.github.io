                <h3> Nice to meet you!</h3>
                <p> Hi there! I'm Moana Marie, a 19-year-old first-year BS Computer Science student. I'm pretty easygoing and approachable, so I'm sure we'll get along well. When I'm not studying, It's either i will read a book or just watch a documentaries or series. It makes me calm and happy!</p>
                <p> I feel a sense of accomplishment when I reflect on my past achievements. At 17, I started working part-time as a tutor to help my parents out. Then, at 18, I became a social media manager, which I still do today. It feels great to be able to contribute financially to my family while gaining valuable experience in the process.</p>
